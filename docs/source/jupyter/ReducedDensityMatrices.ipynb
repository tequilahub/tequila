    "## The 1- and 2-RDM\n",
    "\n",
    "First, look at the definition of the reduced density matrices (RDM) for some state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-RDM: $\\gamma^p_q\\equiv\\langle\\psi|a^pa_q|\\psi\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "2-RDM $\\gamma^{pq}_{rs}\\equiv\\langle\\psi|a^pa^qa_sa_r|\\psi\\rangle$ (we mainly use the standard physics ordering for the second-quantized operators, i.e. $p,r$ go with particle 1 and $q,s$ with particle 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators $a^p=a_p^\\dagger$ and $a_p$ denote the standard fermionic creation and annihilation operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we work on a quantum computer, $|\\psi\\rangle$ is represented by some unitary transformation $U$: $|\\psi\\rangle=U|0\\rangle^{\\otimesN_q}$, using $N_q$ qubits. This corresponds to $N_q$ spin-orbitals in Jordan-Wigner encoding. Obtaining the RDMs from a quantum computer is most intuitive when using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, since the results directly correspond to the ones computed classically in second quantized form.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that since we only consider real orbitals in chemistry applications, the implementation also expects only real-valued RDM's.\n",
    "The well-known anticommutation relations yield a series of symmetry properties for the reduced density matrices, which can be taken into consideration to reduce the computational cost:\n",
    "\\begin{align} \\gamma^p_q &= \\gamma^q_p \\\\ \\gamma^{pq}_{rs} &=-\\gamma^{qp}_{rs}=-\\gamma^{pq}_{sr}=\\gamma^{qp}_{sr}=\\gamma^{rs}_{pq}\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemistry applications, solving the electronic structure problem involves the electronic Hamiltonian (here in Born-Oppenheimer approximation)\n",
    "$$ H_{el} = h_0 + \\sum_{pq} h^q_p a^p_q + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{pqrs} h^{rs}_{pq} a^{pq}_{rs}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the one- and two-body integrals $h^q_p, h^{rs}_{pq}$ that turn out to be independent of spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we introduce the spin-free RDMs $\\Gamma^P_Q$ and $\\Gamma^{PQ}_{RS}$, obtained by spin-summation (we write molecular orbitals in uppercase letters $P,Q,\\ldots\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_p\\}$ in opposite to spin-orbitals $p,q,\\ldots\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_q\\}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align} \\Gamma^P_Q &= \\sum_{\\sigma \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}} \\gamma^{p\\sigma}_{q\\sigma} = \\langle \\psi |\\sum_{\\sigma} a^{p\\sigma} a_{q\\sigma} | \\psi\\rangle \\\\\n",

    " \n",
    "Note, that by making use of linearity, we obtain the second equality in the two expressions above. Performing the summation before evaluating the expected value means less expected values and a considerable reduction in computational cost (only $N_p=\\frac{N_q}{2}$ molecular orbitals vs. $N_q$ spin-orbitals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the orthogonality of the spin states, the symmetries for the spin-free 2-RDM are slightly less than for the spin-orbital RDM:\n",
