    In the overlapping grouping methods, the same Pauli string term can be grouped into
    multiple different fragments. However, for this procedure to reduce the total number of
    required measurements, the coefficients in different fragments have to be optimized with
    the constraint that the sum of the fragments equal the original operator.
    This Class is required for this optimization process. The overlapping grouping methods
    starts from some nonoverlapping groups N_alpha; Pauli strings are then added to several
    compatible fragments with coefficients c_alpha. Because the nonoverlapping groups sum to
    the original operator, the sum of coefficients c_alpha for a given Pauli string has to be
    zero. This is ensured by fixing one of these c_alpha's as -(sum over the rest of c_alpha).
