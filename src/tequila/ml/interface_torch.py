        Notes
        -----

        Though this class is a private class, some explanations of it's implementation may benefit
        curious users and later developers.

        Question: why is this class defined within a function?
        answer: because, since its defined entirely with staticmethods -- about which torch is quite particular --
        it is impossible to use the attribute 'self' to store information for later use.
        This means that, to wrap arbitrary tequila Objectives into this class, the class needs to see the in some
        kind of well contained scope; the function containing this class, get_torch_function, provides that scope.
        in particular, this scoping is used to associate, with this function, arbitrary tequila objectives,
        their gradients with respect to weights or inputs (that is, variables specified to be one or the other)
        and a small dictionary called pattern, which orders the tequila variables w.r.t the order in which a tensor
        of combined input values and weight values are passed down to the function.

        Though this class doesn't have any proper attributes seperate from those it inherits, we detail
        the non-torch objects called within the function here:

        For Forward
        comped_objective: Objective
            a compiled tequila objective; this function has merely wrapped around it to pass torch Tensors into it.


        For Forward and Backward
        samples: int or None:
            how many samples the user wants when sampling the Objective or it's gradients.
